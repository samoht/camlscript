Camlscript is almost an embedded DSL for writing javascript in your OCaml programs.

'almost' because actually, you write OCaml code fragments which are then compiled using ocamljs,
at pre-processing time, into javascript AST. So you will need ocamljs installed to make it work.

The project is not usable at all yet, I'm just prototyping it;
the goal is to make Cass/HTCaML/CamlScript work well together.
